Project Overview: Personalized Snapchat for Sports Fans
1. Overall Project Purpose
Problem Statement:
Current social media platforms, including existing Snapchat, present significant challenges for sports fans by:

Requiring users to navigate multiple platforms to access diverse types of sports content (e.g., news, highlights, fan discussions).

Offering generic Augmented Reality (AR) Lenses and filters that lack personalization to specific teams or fan interests.

Making it difficult for fans to easily connect and engage with other like-minded supporters of their favorite teams.

Solution & Value Proposition:
This project aims to develop an AI-powered, personalized version of Snapchat specifically for sports fans. The core purpose is to consolidate the sports content consumption and fan engagement experience, providing users with:

A single platform for various sports content.

Highly personalized AR experiences, filters, and content suggestions tailored to their favorite teams, players, and interests.

Seamless opportunities to connect and interact within dedicated fan communities, fostering a stronger sense of belonging.

2. Scope
Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP):
The initial version of the application will include fundamental Snapchat functionalities, serving as the MVP:

Real-time photo/video sharing with disappearing messages.

Basic AR filters and camera effects, with a focus on quick personalization.

User authentication and friend management (within the new social graph).

Stories and group messaging functionality.

Future Features (Rapid Implementation Post-MVP):
The identified features for rapid implementation post-MVP include:

Consolidated sports news feeds.

Real-time highlights and game updates.

Enhanced interactive fan communities.

Advanced personalized content suggestions.

Comprehensive Sports Coverage:
The application provides complete integration for all teams across the four major North American sports leagues:

**National Football League (NFL)** - 32 teams
- AFC: 16 teams across 4 divisions (East, North, South, West)  
- NFC: 16 teams across 4 divisions (East, North, South, West)

**National Basketball Association (NBA)** - 30 teams
- Eastern Conference: 15 teams across 3 divisions (Atlantic, Central, Southeast)
- Western Conference: 15 teams across 3 divisions (Northwest, Pacific, Southwest)

**Major League Baseball (MLB)** - 30 teams
- American League: 15 teams across 3 divisions (East, Central, West)
- National League: 15 teams across 3 divisions (East, Central, West)

**National Hockey League (NHL)** - 32 teams
- Eastern Conference: 16 teams across 2 divisions (Atlantic, Metropolitan)
- Western Conference: 16 teams across 2 divisions (Central, Pacific)

**Total Integration**: 124 professional sports teams with complete branding, official colors, and team metadata

Social Graph:
This application will operate on a completely separate social graph, distinct from existing Snapchat friends, focusing exclusively on connecting users based on their shared sports interests.

AI Personalization Data Points:
The AI component will leverage the following user data to personalize the experience:

Teams followed by the user.

Players favorited by the user.

Games watched (indicated by user interaction).

Overall content interacted with (e.g., likes, shares, comments on posts, stories viewed).

3. Goals
Quantitative Goals:

Feature Completeness: All 6 identified user stories (basic Snapchat MVP features + consolidation, engagement, personalization) must be fully functional.

Performance: Achieve sub-3 second response time for all Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-generated content.

Deployment: Successfully deploy a fully functional and accessible mobile application.

Qualitative Goals (RAG Quality & User Experience Focus):

Content Quality: Ensure generated content (e.g., personalized news snippets, AR filter suggestions) accurately matches user interests and preferred writing style.

Personalization: Demonstrate a clear and measurable improvement in content quality and relevance through user-specific RAG and AI recommendations.

Knowledge Integration: Effectively utilize external sports knowledge bases to enhance the depth and accuracy of generated content.

Learning & Improvement: Implement mechanisms for personalization to continuously improve based on user feedback and interaction history.

User Experience: Deliver seamless content generation and consumption workflows that do not interrupt the user's natural flow within the application.

Timeline:

The timeframe for achieving these initial goals is to be determined (TBD), but the aim is for rapid implementation of features beyond the MVP.
