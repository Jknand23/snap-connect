## Technical Implementation Details

### AI/RAG Architecture
```typescript
// RAG Content Generation Service
interface RAGRequest {
  userId: string;
  query: string;
  context: SportsContext;
  contentType: 'news-summary' | 'post-suggestion' | 'chat-response';
}

class AIContentService {
  async generatePersonalizedContent(request: RAGRequest): Promise<AIContent> {
    // 1. Retrieve user preferences and interaction history
    const userContext = await this.getUserContext(request.userId);
    
    // 2. Vector similarity search for relevant sports content
    const relevantContent = await this.searchSimilarContent(request.query, userContext);
    
    // 3. Generate content using OpenAI with sports-specific prompts
    const prompt = this.buildSportsPrompt(request, relevantContent);
    const response = await this.openai.createCompletion({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      prompt,
      max_tokens: 200,
      temperature: 0.7,
    });
    
    return this.processAIResponse(response);
  }
}
```

### Live Sports Data Integration
```typescript
// Sports API Integration Service
class SportsDataService {
  async subscribeToGameUpdates(gameId: string, callback: (update: GameUpdate) => void) {
    // Set up polling for live game updates
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      const update = await this.fetchGameUpdate(gameId);
      if (update.hasChanged) {
        callback(update);
        this.broadcastToSubscribers(gameId, update);
      }
    }, 10000); // Poll every 10 seconds during live games
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
  
  async getPersonalizedSportsNews(userId: string): Promise<SportsNews[]> {
    const preferences = await this.getUserSportsPreferences(userId);
    const news = await Promise.all([
      this.fetchESPNNews(preferences.teams),
      this.fetchSportsDataNews(preferences.players),
    ]);
    
    return this.rankNewsByRelevance(news.flat(), preferences);
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Community System
```typescript
// Community Management Service
interface Community {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  type: 'team-general' | 'game-specific' | 'player-focused';
  memberCount: number;
  activeMembers: number;
  moderators: string[];
  rules: CommunityRule[];
}

class CommunityService {
  async createGameCommunity(gameId: string): Promise<Community> {
    const game = await this.getGameDetails(gameId);
    
    return {
      id: `game-${gameId}`,
      type: 'game-specific',
      name: `${game.awayTeam.name} @ ${game.homeTeam.name}`,
      autoExpire: game.endTime,
      features: ['live-chat', 'reactions', 'predictions'],
    };
  }
}
```
