## Technical Implementation Details

### Advanced AI Architecture
```typescript
// Predictive Analytics Service
class SportsAnalyticsService {
  async predictGameOutcome(gameId: string): Promise<GamePrediction> {
    const gameData = await this.getGameAnalytics(gameId);
    const historicalData = await this.getTeamHistory(gameData.teams);
    const playerStats = await this.getPlayerAnalytics(gameData.players);
    
    // Machine learning model for outcome prediction
    const prediction = await this.mlModel.predict({
      gameData,
      historicalData,
      playerStats,
      weatherConditions: await this.getWeatherData(gameData.venue),
      marketConditions: await this.getBettingOdds(gameId),
    });
    
    return {
      predictedWinner: prediction.winner,
      confidence: prediction.confidence,
      keyFactors: prediction.reasoning,
      updateTime: new Date(),
    };
  }
  
  async detectHighlights(videoContent: VideoContent): Promise<HighlightSegment[]> {
    // AI-powered highlight detection using computer vision
    const analysis = await this.visionAPI.analyzeVideo(videoContent);
    
    return analysis.segments
      .filter(segment => segment.excitement_score > 0.8)
      .map(segment => ({
        startTime: segment.start,
        endTime: segment.end,
        highlightType: this.classifyHighlight(segment),
        confidence: segment.excitement_score,
      }));
  }
}
```

### Creator Economy Platform
```typescript
// Monetization Service
interface CreatorTier {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  monthlyPrice: number;
  benefits: string[];
  exclusiveContent: boolean;
  customARFilters: boolean;
}

class MonetizationService {
  async createSubscription(creatorId: string, subscriberId: string, tierId: string): Promise<Subscription> {
    const tier = await this.getCreatorTier(creatorId, tierId);
    
    // Process payment through Stripe
    const subscription = await this.stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: subscriberId,
      items: [{ price: tier.stripePriceId }],
      metadata: {
        creator_id: creatorId,
        tier_id: tierId,
        platform: 'snapconnect',
      },
    });
    
    // Grant access to exclusive content
    await this.grantTierAccess(subscriberId, tier.benefits);
    
    return subscription;
  }
  
  async processVirtualGift(senderId: string, recipientId: string, giftType: string): Promise<void> {
    const gift = await this.getGiftDetails(giftType);
    
    // Deduct virtual currency from sender
    await this.deductCurrency(senderId, gift.cost);
    
    // Add revenue to recipient (with platform fee)
    const revenue = gift.cost * 0.7; // 30% platform fee
    await this.addCreatorRevenue(recipientId, revenue);
    
    // Send notification to recipient
    await this.notifyGiftReceived(recipientId, senderId, gift);
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Partnership Management Service
interface SportPartner {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'team' | 'league' | 'player' | 'brand';
  verificationLevel: 'verified' | 'official' | 'premier';
  permissions: PartnerPermission[];

}

class PartnershipService {
  async createOfficialContent(partnerId: string, content: OfficialContent): Promise<void> {
    const partner = await this.getPartner(partnerId);
    
    // Verify partner permissions
    if (!partner.permissions.includes('create-official-content')) {
      throw new Error('Partner lacks content creation permissions');
    }
    
    // Enhanced content with official branding
    const enhancedContent = {
      ...content,
      isOfficial: true,
      partnerBadge: partner.verificationLevel,
      priorityPlacement: true,
    };
    
    await this.publishContent(enhancedContent);
    await this.notifyFollowers(partnerId, enhancedContent);
  }
  
  async trackPartnerROI(partnerId: string, campaignId: string): Promise<PartnerAnalytics> {
    const engagement = await this.getContentEngagement(partnerId, campaignId);
    const conversions = await this.getConversionMetrics(partnerId, campaignId);
    const reach = await this.getAudienceReach(partnerId, campaignId);
    
    return {
      totalReach: reach.uniqueUsers,
      engagementRate: engagement.rate,
      conversionRate: conversions.rate,
      roi: this.calculateROI(engagement, conversions, reach),
